This is a 2D side-scrolling shooter game where the player controls a helicopter. Enemies appear from the right side of the screen, including airborne units and ground-based turrets. The player can shoot bullets to destroy the enemies. The player has three lives and loses one upon collision with enemies or their bullets. The game ends when all lives are lost.

Operation mode:

The up, down, left, and right keys control the direction of the helicopter, and the space bar fires bullets.
